# Personal-Health-Record-System
INTRODUCTION

The PHR system helps you to collect, track and share past and current
information about your health or the health of someone in your care. 
Sometimes this information can save you the money and inconvenience of
repeating routine medical tests. Even when routine procedures do need
to be repeated, your PHR can give medical care providers more insight
into your personal health story.
