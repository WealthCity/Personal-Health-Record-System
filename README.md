# Personal-Health-Record-System
INTRODUCTION

The PHR system helps you to collect, track and share past and current
information about your health or the health of someone in your care. 
Sometimes this information can save you the money and inconvenience of
repeating routine medical tests. Even when routine procedures do need
to be repeated, your PHR can give medical care providers more insight
into your personal health story.

This application helps you to take an active role in monitoring your 
health and healthcare by creating your own PHR. PHRs are an 
inevitable and critical step in the evolution of health information
management (HIM). Medical records contain information about your health
compiled and maintained by each of your healthcare providers. A PHR 
is information about your health compiled and maintained by you.
The difference is in how you use your PHR to improve the quality 
of your healthcare.
